						<b class="font-semibold">Hi, I'm Chris Spurlock.</b>
					</p>

					<p>I'm a developer with a journalist's brain, a designer's eye, and a builder's heart. Over the last decade, I've moved fluidly between storytelling, strategy, and software—whether that meant pioneering interactive infographics in a legacy newsroom, launching enterprise-grade WordPress builds, or obsessing over accessibility and user empathy. The through-line? Relentless curiosity and self-directed mastery.</p>

					<p>I spent my early career in journalism, where a lecture on interactive storytelling lit a fire that never really burned out. There was no formal training track, so I built one: learning D3, jQuery, and CSS on nights and weekends to bring stories to life in the browser. Since then, I've applied that same energy to every challenge I’ve encountered—whether it was leading a digital transformation at a major newspaper, coding custom themes from scratch, or jumping into a JS framework I’d never used before... because the project needed it <em>yesterday</em>.</p>

					<p>These days, I'm the COO and UI lead at <a href="https://thekestrel.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Kestrel Co.</a>, a boutique dev agency where I help shape both the work and the workflows. I’m known for wearing many hats—sometimes in the same meeting. Design audits, accessibility reviews, CSS bug hunts, pricing strategy, proposals, GTM tracking setups—I’ve done them all. And I believe my superpower is making teams feel calm, collaborative, and inspired.</p>

					<p>AI is changing the game—and I’m here for it. I see AI as a teammate, not a threat: a pair programmer, a rubber duck, and a research assistant rolled into one. I’m already using GPT to debug, to explore new frameworks, to prototype ideas, and to challenge my own thinking. I’m excited by what this means for the craft of development—and for those of us who care deeply about the people on the other side of the screen.</p>

					<p>What others say:</p>
					<ul class="list-none">
						<li>
							<blockquote>“Chris brings a rare combination of technical expertise and creative insight to every phase of a project—from discovery and UX/UI design through development and launch. His development work is consistently polished, thoughtful, and nearly flawless.”</blockquote>
						</li>
						<li>
							<blockquote>“He grasps the ‘why’ behind each project, ensuring his solutions are both elegant and effective in achieving client goals. His attention to detail and creative problem-solving don’t just result in beautiful, functional websites—they elevate the work of everyone around him.”

					</ul>

					<p>Outside of work, I'm a dad to two tornado toddlers, a husband of nearly ten years, and a distance runner who's rediscovered the meditative joy of the long run. I believe in making work that matters and showing up every day with a bias toward generosity, craft, and clarity.</p>

					<p>If you're looking for someone who can code, design, write, lead, and connect dots others don’t see—I’d love to meet.</p>
