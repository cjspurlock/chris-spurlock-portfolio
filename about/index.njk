					<p class="text-lg md:text-2xl"><b class="font-semibold">Hi Tailwind Labs team!</b></p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled to have the opportunity to apply for the Design Engineer position at Tailwind Labs. With a career that&rsquo;s vacillated between journalism, design, and coding, I&rsquo;ve always been drawn to roles that <a href="https://twitter.com/dennis_kortsch/status/1770464912394846682" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aren&rsquo;t incredibly common</a> and I&rsquo;ve cultivated a unique skill set that I&rsquo;m eager to bring to your team. My knack for self-learning has propelled me through various roles, each time with a keen eye on creating compelling, technically sophisticated online experiences.</p>

					<p>My path to web development began at the University of Missouri where I studied Convergence Journalism. Inspired by a guest lecture on &ldquo;Interactive Infographics&rdquo; from The New York Times&rsquo; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/kevin-quealy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Quealy</a> (he showed us <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/index.html#/?part=tunnel-creek" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&lsquo;Snow Fall&rsquo;</a> and it broke my brain), a passion for non-conventional and interactive reporting took root. Drawn into the digital world of design-as-storytelling, I became a little obsessed with finding out what it would take to bring stories like that to life online. However, there wasn&rsquo;t a dedicated professor or set coursework for an Interactive Infographics emphasis, so I spent the back half of my senior year pursuing it as an independent study, teaching myself the necessary skills to make myself a budding expert.</p>

					<p>From there, self-directed learning sort of became my modus operandi. I began my first post-college job with The Huffington Post armed with rapidly-obsolete Flash skills (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughts_on_Flash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thanks, Steve Jobs</a>) and quickly found myself in the deep end, forced to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the job. I lived on Stack Overflow, cobbling together knowledge piece by piece, feeling like the world&rsquo;s worst &ldquo;developer&rdquo; (and a bit of an imposter, of course). The transition from Flash to front-end was humbling, a daily reminder that in tech, adaptability isn&rsquo;t just a virtue—it&rsquo;s survival.</p>

					<p>After two years, I moved home and went to work at The St. Louis Post-Dispatch where the threat of layoffs loomed as a constant, fueling my drive to learn and grow. I worked alongside an incredible boss, but his experience was steeped in 30 years of print-only presentation. So together, we set out to modernize our storytelling and push the newsroom&rsquo;s technical boundaries. My role evolved into not just updating our digital presence but leading the charge, transforming how stories were told and consumed. Little by little, I helped push a reluctant newsroom into the modern age. It was hard work, but damn, it was rewarding.</p>

					<p>After 2.5 years at the Post-Dispatch, I saw a chance to take the leap full-time into web development when a friend of a friend gave me the opportunity to freelance at <a href="https://thekestrel.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Kestrel Co.</a> (née Switzer Creative). This forced me to dive headfirst into WordPress (which I knew nothing about, let alone any PHP). Hours spent poring over the WordPress docs—and of course yet more Stack Overflow—paid off, and I learned enough to get an offer to come aboard full time. Almost 9 years later I am now a WordPress expert, designing and developing custom themes from scratch for large businesses around the country. I pride myself on crafting sites that are not only visually striking but also accessible and user-friendly, meticulously aligned with WCAG standards. Accessibility has actually become a bit of a passion project this past year, and I&rsquo;ve parlayed that into a core line of service for our agency.</p>

					<p>As I mentioned, I know WordPress like the back of my hand at this point, but as a dev shop operating in both direct-to business as well as <a href="https://thekestrel.co/agencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agency partnership arrangements</a>, our work is so varied that I dabble in all sorts of tech. Our <a href="https://underscoretw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard WordPress starter theme is based on Tailwind</a> and uses PostCSS to compile, and before that we had a <a href="https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gulp-based</a> approach so I'm familiar with that as well (and all of this is a 1000% improvement over the old CodeKit days). I've helped build a custom React form inside a WordPress theme using <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/reactpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReactPress</a>, and I've worked on small Vue apps and large Angular ones. I use Alpine JS in my work daily and love it (it&rsquo;s the Tailwind of JS!), and I&rsquo;ve dabbled with static site generators like Eleventy, Gatsby, and Next as well. I've also leaned on UI component libraries like Tailwind UI, Radix, and HeadlessUI when necessary. On the design side, Figma is my current weapon of choice (and I love using <a href="https://www.untitledui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Untitled UI</a> as a starting point, especially for web apps, dashboards, etc), but I also have experience with Sketch, Adobe XD, InVision (so long, old friend!), Photoshop, and Illustrator. And marrying the two together, I've of course played with Lottie and GSAP.</p>

					<p>To stay up to date with an industry that moves at 100 mph (or 160.934 kph for the Canadians reading this), I make sure to have quality Twitter/X follows (hey <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanphughes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jordan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/steveschoger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chriscoyier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/wesbos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wes</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/stolinski" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/argyleink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam</a>, etc), subscribe to <a href="https://www.todayin.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">way</a> <a href="https://sidebar.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">too</a> <a href="https://frontendfoc.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many</a> <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newsletters</a>, and listen to a <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast</a> or <a href="https://syntax.fm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two</a> as well.</p>

					<p>If it isn&rsquo;t clear by now, I&rsquo;ll try to state it plainly: the constant in my career has been a relentless drive to learn and master whatever skills were needed, from coding to SEO, social media, proposal writing, sales, business development, project management, and beyond.</p>

					<p>At Tailwind Labs, I see an incredible opportunity to apply this learning ethos to new challenges like the v4 website build, new template designs, color palette generation, and the chance to dig deeper into APIs.</p>

					<p>On a personal note, balancing life as a father of two toddlers, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/spurlock.fit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new runner training for a half marathon</a>, and a husband gearing up to celebrate a decade of marriage has enriched my professional perspective. These roles have honed my time management skills, deepened my understanding of life&rsquo;s complexities, enriched my professional outlook, taught me the importance of balance and continuous personal growth—and also made me very tired (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-caitlyn-collins.html?ugrp=m&unlocked_article_code=1.hk0.dD8a.RdJVJ2y8FolN&smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what&rsquo;s up parents, are you OK?</a>)</p>

					<p>Joining Tailwind Labs would merge my passion for innovative web development with a like-minded team that values creativity and technical prowess without taking itself too seriously. I&rsquo;m excited about the prospect of contributing to a company that&rsquo;s shaping the future of digital design and development. Your team inspires me and my team every day, and it&rsquo;s a privilege just to apply for this role. Honestly.</p>

					<p>Thank you for considering my application! I&rsquo;m looking forward to discussing how my background, skills, and passions align with the groundbreaking work at Tailwind Labs.</p>

						<p class="!mt-0"><strong>P.S. </strong>I realize I may not perfectly fit the time zone requirements, but please don&rsquo;t let that be the reason you pass me up! I&rsquo;m only one time zone off!</p>
						<p class="!mb-0">Our agency has successfully collaborated with developers across the U.S., South America, Canada, Europe, and parts of Asia without issue. I know you do quite a bit of real-time collaboration and have developers in Europe, so if necessary, I am 100% prepared and willing to adjust my working hours to sync with the team. As a dad of toddlers and an early-morning runner, I&rsquo;m no stranger to waking at all hours and adjusting my schedule as needed!</p>
